    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hello! I'm a passionate and dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong foundation in web development, AI, and machine learning. My journey in tech has been shaped by hands-on experiences through various internships, certifications, and projects, each contributing to my growth as a developer and problem-solver.

I've completed multiple prestigious certifications, including 3 AICTE internships with Blue Prism, Juniper, and Google AIML, where I deepened my knowledge in automation, networking, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, I've earned 12 Infosys Springboard certifications, enriching my skills in areas crucial to a modern CSE professional.

My academic pursuits led me to successfully complete 6 NPTEL courses, covering programming languages and social awareness, further solidifying my technical expertise and understanding of broader societal contexts. I was also selected for the IIT Gandhinagar ACM Summer School on Generative AI, where I explored cutting-edge technology, including chatbot development and text search mechanisms.

In practical applications, I’ve worked on several web development projects, such as creating a travel brochure website and Pharmacare, a pharmacy management system designed to track medicine stocks efficiently. My passion for innovation extends to leading a team in the Smart India Hackathon, where we developed an AI-driven solution to combat cyberbullying and cybercrimes—a project that showcased my leadership and technical skills.

Recently, I had the privilege of interning with Octanet and Navodita Infotech, where I gained hands-on experience and honed my web development skills further. I'm also participating in hackathons like Walmart's, where I'm working on an AI-Powered Personalized Shopping Assistant, demonstrating my ability to apply AI to real-world challenges.

I'm currently focused on developing a chatbot using React and Flask, capable of handling CSV file inputs and providing insightful responses. This project, along with others, is part of my broader goal to showcase my coding skills and contribute meaningful solutions to everyday problems.

With a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, I'm eager to explore new challenges and opportunities in the tech industry. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see my work in action!
